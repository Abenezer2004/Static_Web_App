                    <p>All Might, whose real name is Toshinori Yagi, is the former No. 1 Hero and the Symbol of Peace in the world of My Hero Academia. He was born with the Quirk "One For All," which allows him to stockpile and transfer power to others.

                    <p>Throughout his career, All Might fought against villains and protected the innocent, earning him immense respect and admiration. However, due to a severe injury sustained in a battle with his arch-nemesis All For One, All Might's body was severely damaged, limiting his ability to use his powers effectively. Despite this, he continued to serve as a mentor and symbol of hope for aspiring heroes, particularly for Midoriya Izuku (Deku), whom he chose as his successor to inherit One For All.</p>
